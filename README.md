# point-cloud-project
This project is the culmination of a two-year-long research project in partnership with WSUV's mathematics department. The research details an efficient way of finding the volume of a roughly cylindrical object given a partial point cloud of said object. Specifically, this involves a fast and efficient two-dimensional sorting algorithm for three-dimensional partial point clouds.
